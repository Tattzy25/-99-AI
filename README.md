# Bridgit-AI Translator Card

This project implements a neumorphic translator card UI as described, using reusable components for language selection, input, output, and microphone button. The layout adapts for both desktop and mobile, and clicking the 'B' icon opens a menu popup.

## Features
- Two language dropdowns (left and right)
- Swap button in the center
- Input field for text
- Output field for translation state
- Microphone button below
- 'B' menu button at the top
- Responsive neumorphic design

## Getting Started
